# React Project Documentation

This folder contains comprehensive documentation for all features, epics, and components in this React application.

## Documentation Structure

### Feature Documentation
- `feature-{name}-documentation.md` - Individual feature implementations
- Include component usage, API integration, testing coverage
- Follow the [documentation template](../../PRPs/templates/documentation_template.md)

### Epic Documentation  
- `epic-{name}-documentation.md` - Large feature sets or major capabilities
- Cover multiple related features and their interactions
- Include architectural decisions and integration patterns

### Project Documentation
- `api-integration.md` - External API usage patterns and examples
- `testing-guide.md` - Testing approach, coverage, and examples
- `component-library.md` - Reusable component documentation
- `troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming Convention
- Use kebab-case: `feature-user-authentication-documentation.md`
- Use descriptive names: `epic-e-commerce-cart-documentation.md`
- Include type prefix: `feature-` or `epic-`

### Content Requirements
Each documentation file must include:

1. **Overview** - Purpose and business value
2. **Components** - Created/modified components with usage examples
3. **API Integration** - External APIs and data flow patterns
4. **Testing** - Coverage summary and test patterns
5. **Dependencies** - New libraries and configuration
6. **Usage Examples** - Code snippets and integration patterns
7. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

### Code Examples
Always include:
- TypeScript interfaces and types
- Component usage examples
- API integration patterns
- Error handling examples
- Test scenarios

## Navigation

## Maintenance

### Documentation Updates
- Update documentation when features are modified
- Keep code examples current with implementation
- Review and update every 3 months
- Remove outdated documentation for deprecated features

### Quality Standards
- All code examples must be tested and working
- Include TypeScript types for all examples
- Use consistent formatting and style
- Provide clear, actionable troubleshooting steps

## Template Usage

When creating new documentation, use the template at:
`../../PRPs/templates/documentation_template.md`

Copy the template and fill in all sections relevant to your feature or epic.
