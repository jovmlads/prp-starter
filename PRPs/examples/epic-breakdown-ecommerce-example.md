**This definitive breakdown provides 8 Epics with 40 specific features that can be implemented using the standard PRP workflow. Each Epic has clear ownership, dependencies, and implementation commands for immediate execution.**

## Next Steps

1. **Epic Validation**: Review Epic boundaries with stakeholders and technical leads

2. **Team Formation**: Assign Epic ownership based on team strengths:

   ```
   Team Alpha: Infrastructure + Analytics (systems expertise)
   Team Beta: Payments + Inventory (transaction/ops expertise)
   Team Gamma: Orders (business logic expertise)
   Team Delta: Storefront (frontend/UX expertise)
   ```

3. **Epic Feature Breakdown**: For each Epic, run detailed planning:

   ```
   /planning-create Epic C1: Product Catalog Management with multi-tenant architecture
   /planning-create Epic C2: Order Management System with payment integration
   /planning-create Epic C3: Customer Storefront with performance optimization
   ```

4. **API Contract Definition**: Establish Epic API contracts before implementation begins

5. **Integration Testing Strategy**: Define cross-Epic integration validation approach

**This breakdown enables 4 teams to work in parallel with minimal coordination overhead while building a comprehensive e-commerce platform. Each Epic delivers independent business value while contributing to the overall platform vision.**
