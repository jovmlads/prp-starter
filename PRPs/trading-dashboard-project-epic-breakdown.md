## Project Goal & Vision

**Project Name**: Trading Dashboard

**Vision Statement**: A comprehensive React-based trading dashboard that provides real-time market data, trade management, statistical analysis, and secure user authentication for active traders.

**Strategic Objectives**:

- Enable traders to monitor active positions and market conditions in real-time
- Provide comprehensive trading statistics and performance analytics
- Deliver industry-standard security for sensitive financial data
- Create an intuitive, responsive interface using modern UI components

**Target Timeline**: 8-12 weeks for full implementation

**Team Structure**: 3-4 developers working on parallel Epics, with potential for AI agent assistance

## Project Scope Definition

### Core Business Capabilities

**Primary User Journeys**:

1. **Trader Authentication**: User → Secure Login → Dashboard Access → Protected Trading Data
2. **Trading Monitoring**: User → Home Dashboard → View Active Trades → Monitor P&L and Risk Metrics
3. **Market Analysis**: User → Market Widgets → Check Trading Conditions → View Top Gainers
4. **Performance Analytics**: User → Statistics Page → Review Historical Performance → Analyze Trading Patterns

**Key Business Rules**:

- **Risk Management**: All trades must display risk:reward ratios and stop/target levels
- **Market Data Accuracy**: Real-time price data with appropriate fallback for API limitations
- **Data Security**: All user authentication and trading data must be encrypted and secure
- **Performance Tracking**: Complete audit trail of all trades with statistical analysis

**Success Criteria**:

- [ ] **User Authentication**: Secure login/logout with session management
- [ ] **Real-time Dashboard**: Live market data and trade monitoring with <2s latency
- [ ] **Statistical Analysis**: Complete trading performance metrics and visualizations
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface using shadcn/ui components
- [ ] **Data Persistence**: Reliable data storage and retrieval via Supabase

### Technology & Architecture Context

**Technology Stack**:

```yaml
# Core Technology Decisions
frontend: React 18+ with TypeScript
ui_framework: shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS
state_management: React Query + Zustand
routing: React Router v6
charts: shadcn/ui charts (built on Recharts)
backend: Supabase (Auth + Database + Real-time)
database: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
api_integration: Free financial APIs (Alpha Vantage, Polygon free tier)
deployment: Vercel or Netlify
```

**Architectural Patterns**:

- **Architecture Style**: Frontend-focused SPA with Supabase backend-as-a-service
- **Data Strategy**: Real-time subscriptions with cached market data
- **Integration Pattern**: RESTful APIs with WebSocket connections for live data
- **Security Model**: Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) with JWT authentication
- **Chart Strategy**: shadcn/ui charts for consistent design system integration

**Technical Constraints**:

- **Free API Limits**: Use free tier APIs with appropriate caching and rate limiting
- **Real-time Requirements**: Market data updates every 15-60 seconds (free tier limitations)
- **Security Compliance**: Industry-standard authentication and data protection
- **Performance**: Sub-3 second page loads and responsive UI interactions

## Epic Decomposition Strategy

### Independence Criteria

**For each Epic to be truly independent, it must have:**

- [x] **Data Independence**: Own database tables and data models
- [x] **API Boundaries**: Clear interfaces between frontend components and data services
- [x] **Deployment Independence**: Individual features can be deployed separately
- [x] **Team Independence**: Different developers can work on separate Epics
- [x] **Testing Independence**: Each Epic can be tested with mocked dependencies

### Epic Priority Framework

**Priority Levels**:

1. **Foundation Epics**: Authentication, database setup, UI foundation (Must be first)
2. **Core Epics**: Trading dashboard, market data integration (High business value)
3. **Enhancement Epics**: Advanced statistics, performance analytics (Value-add features)

**This definitive breakdown provides 7 Epics with 32 specific features that can be implemented using the standard PRP workflow. Each Epic has clear ownership, dependencies, and implementation commands for immediate execution.**

## Next Steps

1. **Epic Prioritization**: Review Epic breakdown and confirm development sequence

2. **Team Assignment**: Assign Epic ownership to development teams

3. **Supabase Setup**: Initialize Supabase project with database schema

4. **Epic Planning**: For each Epic, run detailed feature breakdown using:

   ```
   /planning-create Epic [Epic-Name]: [Epic scope and capabilities]
   ```

5. **Feature Development**: For each feature within Epics, create detailed PRPs using:

   ```
   /create-base-prp [Feature description] within Epic [Epic-Name]
   ```

6. **Integration Testing**: Establish cross-Epic integration validation processes
