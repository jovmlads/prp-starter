# Hello AI Agent - Single Page React Application PRD ðŸ“‹

## Overview

A minimal single-page React application that displays a title "Hello AI Agent". This serves as a foundation for future React development using the PRPs framework.

## User Stories

```yaml
As a user:
  - I want to see a welcoming title "Hello AI Agent" when I visit the page
  - I want the application to load quickly and be responsive
```

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack

```yaml
Frontend:
  - React (latest version)
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - Vite for fast development and building
  - Modern CSS practices for styling

Development Tools:
  - ESLint + TypeScript plugin
  - Prettier for code formatting
  - Vitest for testing
```

### Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx            # Main application component
â”œâ”€â”€ main.tsx          # Application entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/           # Styling
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ App.css      # Main application styles
â””â”€â”€ vite-env.d.ts    # TypeScript environment declarations
```

### Component Architecture

```yaml
App (Root Component):
  Purpose: Main application container
  Responsibilities:
    - Renders the page title
    - Provides basic layout structure
    - Implements responsive design
```

## Implementation Details

### Setup Requirements

```yaml
Development Environment:
  - Node.js >= 18.x
  - npm or yarn package manager
  - VS Code with recommended extensions
```

### UI/UX Design

```yaml
Layout:
  - Centered container layout
  - Responsive design adapting to screen sizes

Typography:
  - Modern, clean font (system font stack)
  - Clear hierarchy with the title prominently displayed

Colors:
  - Use neutral, professional color scheme
  - Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility
```

### Quality Standards

```yaml
Code Quality:
  - TypeScript strict mode enabled
  - ESLint rules enforced
  - Component tests with Vitest
  - Responsive design testing

Performance:
  - Fast initial load time
  - Optimal bundle size
  - No unnecessary dependencies
```

## Testing Strategy

```yaml
Unit Tests:
  - Verify App component renders
  - Confirm title text is present
  - Check basic styling applied

Integration Tests:
  - Verify application mounts correctly
  - Test responsive behavior
```

## Delivery Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup

1. Initialize Vite project with React and TypeScript
2. Configure ESLint and Prettier
3. Set up testing environment

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

1. Create App component with title
2. Implement basic styling
3. Add responsive design

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance

1. Write and run tests
2. Perform code review
3. Test across different screen sizes

## Future Considerations

- Potential for adding more interactive features
- Integration with backend services
- Enhancement of visual design
- Addition of animations or transitions

## Success Criteria

- Application successfully displays "Hello AI Agent" title
- All tests passing
- Code meets quality standards
- Responsive on different screen sizes
- Fast load time
- No console errors or warnings
